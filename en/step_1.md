Craft and utility knives are very useful when making models, but you must be very careful when using them, as they are extremely sharp and can easily cause an injury. 

If you are using a craft or utility knife, make sure you have a responsible adult with you, or ask them to do the cutting for you if you prefer. 

It's also a good idea to use a cutting mat to protect the surface you are working on. If you don't have a cutting mat, a kitchen chopping board is a great alternative but ask permission before you use something that isn't yours.
